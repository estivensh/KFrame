## Status

| Product | Android  | iOS      |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Camera  | ☑️ alpha | ☑️ alpha |
| Video   | ☑️ alpha | ☑️ alpha |
| Flash   | ☑️ alpha | ☑️ alpha |

## Implementation

add the dependency `build.gradle.kts` file:

```kotlin
commonMain.dependencies {
    implementation("io.github.estivensh:kaptureX:$version")
}
```

## Basic Usage
Below is a basic example of how to use the CameraPreview component in your application:

```kotlin
@OptIn(ExperimentalCameraPreview::class)
@Composable
fun MyCameraScreen() {
    val cameraState = rememberCameraState()

    CameraPreview(
        cameraState = cameraState,
        camSelectorOnChanged = { newSelector ->

        },
        flashModeOnChanged = { newFlashMode ->

        },
        cameraOptionOnChanged = { newOption ->

        }
    )
}
```

## Customizable Parameters
The CameraPreview component offers a wide variety of parameters to customize its behavior:

- <b>cameraState:</b> Current camera state. Use rememberCameraState() to handle and remember the camera state

- <b>camSelector:</b> Selects the camera (front or back). You can handle camera switching using camSelectorOnChanged.

- <b>flashMode:</b> Configures the camera's flash mode. You can change it using flashModeOnChanged.

- <b>captureMode:</b> Defines the capture mode (image or video).

- <b>imageCaptureMode:</b> Sets the image capture mode (high quality or fast speed).

- <b>zoomRatio:</b> CControls the zoom level. You can handle zoom changes with onZoomRatioChanged.

- <b>isImageAnalysisEnabled:</b> Enables or disables real-time image analysis.

- <b>onPreviewStreamChanged:</b> Callback executed when the preview stream changes.

```kotlin
@OptIn(ExperimentalCameraPreview::class)
@Composable
fun CameraSection(
    cameraState: CameraState,
    useFrontCamera: Boolean,
    usePinchToZoom: Boolean
) {
    var flashMode by cameraState.rememberFlashMode(FlashMode.valueOf("On"))
    var camSelector by rememberCamSelector(if (useFrontCamera) CamSelector.Front else CamSelector.Back)
    var zoomRatio by rememberSaveable { mutableStateOf(cameraState.minZoom) }
    var zoomHasChanged by rememberSaveable { mutableStateOf(false) }
    var cameraOption by rememberSaveable { mutableStateOf(CameraOption.Video) }
    val enableTorch = true
    CameraPreview(
        cameraState = cameraState,
        camSelector = camSelector,
        captureMode = cameraOption.toCaptureMode(),
        flashMode = flashMode,
        enableTorch = enableTorch,
        zoomRatio = zoomRatio,
        isPinchToZoomEnabled = usePinchToZoom,
        onZoomRatioChanged = {
            zoomHasChanged = true
            zoomRatio = it
        },
        onSwitchToFront = { _ ->

        },
        onSwitchToBack = { _ ->

        },
        camSelectorOnChanged = { camSelector = it },
        flashModeOnChanged = { flashMode = it },
        cameraOptionOnChanged = { cameraOption = it },
        cameraOption = cameraOption,
    )
}
```
