        type = DeviceType.DESKTOP,
        name = "my_custom_desktop"
    ),
    name = "My Desktop",
    screenSize = Size(1440f, 900f),
    screenPath = myCustomPainter.createScreenPath(screenSize),
    pixelRatio = 1.0f,
    safeAreas = EdgeInsets.Zero,
    framePainter = myCustomPainter,
    frameSize = myCustomPainter.calculateFrameSize(screenSize)
)
```
